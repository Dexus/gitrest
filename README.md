===============

This is the source code behind [raw.git.rest](https://raw.git.rest).

The  idea  of this  service  is  inspired from  [rawgit.com](http://rawgit.com)
(formerly rawgithub.com). I just realized that using a whole framework (node.js
with express.js) for such simple thing as requests proxying is overkilling, and
made same stuff using nginx only.

This is also a game: I am trying to implement the same functionality using nginx
config files only. No programming languages allowed. Come join me!
